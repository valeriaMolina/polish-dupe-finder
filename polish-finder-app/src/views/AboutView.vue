        <h3>Hey there, welcome!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm so glad you're here! Nail Polish Finder is my passion project, created for people who
          love nail polish just as much as I do. I know the struggle of searching for that perfect
          shade or trying to find a close match to a discontinued favorite. This website is all
          about making that search easier and way more fun.
        </p>
        <h4>My Mission</h4>
        <p>
          I want Polish Finder to be your go-to spot for all things nail polish. Here's what you can
          do:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the advanced search to find polishes based on brand, type, color, and formula.
          </li>
          <li>Save favorites to keep track of your favorite polishes in one convenient place.</li>
          <li>Add new polishes and brands to the database to help the community grow.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Journey</h4>
        <p>
          This started as a project to combine my love for nail polish and my passion for coding.
          I've coded everything from scratch, from the user-friendly interface to the back-end that
          makes the search and recommendations work smoothly.
        </p>
