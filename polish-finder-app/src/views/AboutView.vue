      <h3>Hey there, welcome!</h3>
      <p>
        Polish Finder is a passion project that I created to teach myself web development. I know
        the struggle of searching for that perfect polish or trying to find a dupe to a discontinued
        favorite. This website is all about making that search easier and more fun.
      </p>
      <h4>My Mission</h4>
      <p>
        I want Polish Finder to be your go-to spot for all things nail polish. Here's what you can
        do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the advanced search to find polishes based on brand, type, color, and formula.</li>
        <li>Save favorites to keep track of your favorite polishes in one convenient place.</li>
        <li>Add new polishes and brands to the database to help the community grow.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Journey</h4>
      <p>
        This started as a project to combine my love for nail polish and my passion for coding. I've
        coded everything from scratch, from the user-friendly interfaceto the back-end that makes
        the search and recommendations work smoothly.
      </p>
      <h3>Cool Features</h3>

      </ul>

        ultimate resource for nail polish enthusiasts everywhere.
